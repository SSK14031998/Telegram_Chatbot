## Telegram ChatBot

This is a sample telegram bot developed using Python.
This was done in IDLE, however I haven't tried it in Jupyter or VSCode.
Steps to run:
- Open your Telegram Account in Desktop/Laptop
- Search for BotFather (select the one with the blue checked)
- Follow the steps to create a token for your own bot.
- Save the token as a text file.
- Load the file into the code.
- You can also change the replies given by the chatbot accordingly.
